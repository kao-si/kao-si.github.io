I enjoy reading, particularly history. Besides books, I also read from Wikipedia and listen to talks and seminars on Youtube.

I have been taking pictures since some time ago. I play with a Hasselblad 500CM, a Nikon FM2, a Canon EOS 5D Mark II, and my iPhone. [My Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mac_si/)

I enjoy doing sports. I do basketball, football, swimming, and cycling (wish I could). I am a supporter of Chelsea FC.
