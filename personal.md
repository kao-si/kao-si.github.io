I enjoy reading, particularly history. Besides books, I also read from Wikipedia and listen to talks on Youtube, mostly by Professor Gao Hua (高華), Professor Han Gang (韓鋼), Professor Qin Hui (秦暉), and others.

I have been taking pictures since some time ago. I play with a Hasselblad 500CM, a Nikon FM2, a Canon EOS 5D Mark II, and my iPhone. [My Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mac_si/)

I enjoy doing sports. I play basketball, football, swimming, and cycling, [if I could](https://mackintoshsikao.wordpress.com/2011/07/10/%e5%8f%b0%e7%81%a3%e5%96%ae%e8%bb%8a%e7%92%b0%e5%b3%b6%e9%81%8a%e8%a8%98-17/). I am a supporter of Chelsea FC.
